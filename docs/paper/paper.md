# Summary

Climate data is an essential input for crop models to predict crop growth and development using site-specific (point) or gridded climate data. While point data is currently available in MET format, gridded data is provided in NetCDF file format which is difficult to store and convert to an input file readable by APSIM[^1] or other crop models. We developed `Bestiapop` (a spanish word that translates to *pop beast*), a Python package which allows model users to automatically download SILO's (Scientific Information for Land Owners) gridded climate data in MET file format that can then be inputted by APSIM for crop modelling predictions. The package offers the possibility to select a range of grids (5 km Ã— 5 km resolution) and years producing various types of output files (csv and MET). Although the code downloads data from the SILO[^2] database, it could be applied to other climate data sources e.g. NASA POWER[^3] as was implemented in R using APSIM CRAN[^4]. `Bestiapop` was designed to be used by researchers interested in crop modelling (e.g. [@Ojeda:2020]).The combination of speed, design, and support for gridded climate data extraction and analysis in `Bestiapop` will enable exciting scientific explorations on climate change analysis and could be potentially extended to other models such as ecological and hydrological models.
